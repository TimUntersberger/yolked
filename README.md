Lifting program creator, manager and more.

The idea is to use google docs as the "database" so that a user can have access to all of the data easily. This also makes it possible to host the whole website using github pages.

"Downloading" a program can be done by pasting a string of data (not sure which format yet).

The program editor should make it easy to configure transitions.

Example:

Once you hit 4x12 at weight -> increase weight by 2.5kg and go to 4x8

Maybe a node based visual editor would be cool?

The user should also be able to easily modify his current program if something unexpect happens in his life, whether the user just doesn't have time to fit in a session or is too fatigued.

The MVP should support manual progressive overload, meaning that the program can't tell the user which weight and how many reps/sets he SHOULD hit and instead the user would have to estimate it based on the previous session.
